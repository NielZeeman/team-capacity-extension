# Team Capacity Overview

Are you or your team members assigned to multiple teams?
Having problems seeing where individuals are assigned and how much capacity has been allocated? 

When the team members are assigned to multiple teams it is difficult to get an overall view of the allocation of members. You need to navigate to each team in the project to see the allocation.

## One pane of glass
Have a single view of all the members of the various teams and where they are allocated. This gives you the birds eye view of capacity across all the teams in the team project.
It provides the single "pane of glass" to see where the team members are active and how much of their time is allocated.

Feel free to install it from the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tfc.team-capacity) and provide me some [feedback](https://github.com/NielZeeman/team-capacity-extension/issues).
